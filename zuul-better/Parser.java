 * This class is part of "World of Zuul". "World of Zuul" is a simple,

 *
 * This parser takes user input and tries to interpret it as a "Zuul"
 * command. Every time it is called it takes a line as a String and
 * tries to interpret the line as a two word command. It returns the command
 * as an object of class Command.
 *
 * The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against
 * the known commands, and if the input is not one of the known commands, it
 * returns a command object that is marked as an unknown command.
